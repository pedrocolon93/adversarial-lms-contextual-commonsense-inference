                You are helping to determine whether a statement that was generated would be true for most people.
                After this, you are then given a certain story context with a bolded sentence, and will determine once more if the statement, given the context with emphasis on the <i>italicized sentence</i>, would be true for most people.
                You should not take into consideration the grammatical correctness of the sentence.
                Lastly, you are given another statement and will determine  if the new statement, given the context with emphasis on the <i>italicized sentence</i>, would be true for most people.
